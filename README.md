##Flask API

<p>I followed the video by Brad from Traversy Media. This is a very simple REST API built using SQL Alchemy and Flask.</p><br></br>

<p><h6>New Updates:</h6></p>

```
product_schema = ProductSchema()
products_schema = ProductSchema(many=True)
```
Make sure it doesn't have the ```strict=True``` parameter in it. 


<h6>My two cents:</h6>

<li>Try to integrate with the Front-End. </li>
<li>Perhaps try to find out how to add CORS (Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing) policy in this API otherwise Front-End may not work</li>
<li>In fact this applied to me too. Will try to learn JWT Authentication and Authorization in it</li>
<li>Dockerise this API</li><br><br>

<strong>Thanks,</strong><br></br>
